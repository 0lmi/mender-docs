This sections lists all the configuration options in `mender.conf`. Some of
these options can also be modified using Yocto variables.

#### ArtifactVerifyKey

Specifies the location of the public key used to verify signed updates, and also
enables signed-updates-only mode when it is set. If set the client will reject
incorrectly signed updates, or updates without a signature. See also the section
about [signing and verification](../../../artifacts/signing-and-verification).

#### InventoryPollIntervalSeconds

An integer that sets the number of seconds to wait between each inventory
update. Note that the client may occasionally post its inventory more often if
there has been recent activity on the device. See also the section about
[polling intervals](../polling-intervals).

#### ModuleTimeoutSeconds

An integer that specifies the number of seconds that an update module will be
allowed to run, before it is considered hanging and killed. The process will
first be sent a SIGTERM signal, and one minute later, if it has not exited,
SIGKILL. The default is 4 hours.

#### RetryPollIntervalSeconds

An integer that sets the number of seconds to wait between each attempt to
download an update file. Note that the client may attempt more often initially
to enable rapid upgrades, but will gradually fall back to this value if the
server is busy. See also the section about [polling
intervals](../polling-intervals).

#### RootfsPartA

The Linux device that contains root filesystem A. This is set by the build
system based on Yocto configuration and rarely needs to be modified.

#### RootfsPartB

The Linux device that contains root filesystem B. This is set by the build
system based on Yocto configuration and rarely needs to be modified.

#### Servers

An array of json objects of the format
`[{ServerURL: "https://mender-server.com"},
{ServerURL: "https://mender-server2.com"}, ...]`, where `ServerURL` has the
same format as the plain [`ServerURL` attribute](#ServerURL) paragraph. If
`Servers` entry is specified, the configuration cannot contain an additional
`ServerURL` entry in the top level of the json configuration. Upon an unserved
request (4XX/5XX-response codes) the client will attempt the next server on the
list in the given order.

#### ServerURL

The server URL which is used as the basis for API requests. This should be set
to the server that runs the Mender server services. It should include the whole
URL, including `https://` and a trailing slash.
*NOTE: This entry conflicts with [`Servers` attribute](#Servers), i.e. only one
of these entries are accepted.*

#### ServerCertificate

The location of the public certificate of the server, if any. If this
certificate is missing, or the one presented by the server doesn't match the one
specified in this setting, the server certificate will be validated using
standard certificate trust chains.

#### StateScriptRetryIntervalSeconds

The timeout before a state script that previously returned the special retry
return code (21), will be run again.

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender v%"/ignore-->
*Note*: Before mender v2.0.0 release, this option used to be called `StateScriptRetryTimeoutSeconds`.

#### StateScriptRetryTimeoutSeconds

The interval for which the script is allowed to keep retrying. After this
interval has expired, another retry attempt will be treated as a failure and if
possible, the update will be rolled back.

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender v%"/ignore-->
*Note*: Before mender v2.0.0 release, this option used to be called `StateScriptRetryIntervalSeconds`.

#### StateScriptTimeoutSeconds

The number of seconds to wait for any state script to terminate. If a script
exceeds this running time, its process group will be killed and Mender will
continue, treating the script as having failed. See also the section about
[state scripts](../../../artifacts/state-scripts).

#### TenantToken

A token which identifies which tenant a device belongs to. This is only relevant
if using Hosted Mender.

#### UpdateLogPath

The location where deployment logs will be written. This must be on a persistent
partition to work correctly.

#### UpdatePollIntervalSeconds

An integer that sets the number of seconds to wait between each check for a new
update. Note that the client may occasionally check more often if there has been
recent activity on the device. See also the section about [polling
intervals](../polling-intervals).
