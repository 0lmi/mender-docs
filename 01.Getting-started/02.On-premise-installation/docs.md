Mender is an open source remote software updater for embedded Linux devices.
It enables management of software updates to connected devices remotely over any TCP/IP network.
For a high-level introduction to Mender and its architecture, we recommend reading [How It Works](https://mender.io/how-it-works?target=_blank) on mender.io.

This section of the documentation contains tutorials to help you set up a demo server and deploy your first update with Mender. Going from a fresh system to completing your first deployment with Mender, including server setup, should take **less than 30 minutes**.

! Do not follow this getting started documentation if you are using [hosted Mender](https://hosted.mender.io?target=_blank). Instead, follow the [Quickstart guide for Raspberry Pi](../quickstart-with-raspberry-pi) or the instructions you received in the welcome email when you signed up.

To begin on-premise installation, first take a look at the [requirements](requirements).
